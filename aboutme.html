    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     This is my personal space to share my passions, projects, and the journey I’ve been on. Whether you’re here to explore my work or just browsing, I hope you find something that resonates with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been captivated by computers and technology but it all really started with video games. Playing games wasn’t just fun for me; it sparked a curiosity about how they worked behind the scenes. I remember wondering how worlds were built, characters were animated, and mechanics were programmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That early passion for gaming eventually led me down the path of programming. I wanted to create, not just consume. Over time, I began learning how to build my own games and applications, turning that curiosity into real skills. Today, I’m pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science at UMBC</strong>, and I’ve had the opportunity to work at the <strong>Apple Store</strong>, where I’ve gained insight into both the technical and business sides of the tech world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m driven by that same sense of wonder that video games sparked in me years ago and I’m excited to see where it will lead.
